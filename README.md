my first project was made in Visual Studio 2022, using C++ for code and SFML for graphics.
this project was for my programming I course and i felt so good to do this game.
PD: this needs SMFL 3.0.2 to work in your project properties, here is the link to download it: https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/3.0.2/
have fun!
